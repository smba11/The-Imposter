# The-Imposter
🎭 The Imposter Game

## Play in the browser
This project includes a browser-friendly version you can host with GitHub Pages.

You can deploy from either location:

- **Root** (`/`): use the files at the repo root (`index.html`, `web.js`).
- **Docs** (`/docs`): use the same files inside `docs/` (`docs/index.html`, `docs/web.js`).

### GitHub Pages setup
1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In your repository settings, enable GitHub Pages.
3. Choose either the root (`/`) or `/docs` folder as the source.
4. Visit the published URL to play.

### If the page still shows only the README title
- Double-check the GitHub Pages source setting (root vs `/docs`).
- Confirm the branch you selected is the one with `index.html` and `web.js`.
- Wait a minute after saving the Pages settings for the site to rebuild.
- This repo includes `.nojekyll` markers in both the root and `docs/` to prevent Jekyll from overriding the static site.
